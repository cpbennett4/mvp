# Event Interest Email List #

## Sub-Heading ##
This is created for people who want to gauge interest in their event.

## Summary ##
This app allows users to input their name and email as an expression of interest in an event.  They will also be able to gauge the interest of others for the event by seeing who else submitted their names, though advanced features will include the ability to opt out of others seeing your name.  In this case, a list of names will be provided as well as a simple count of users who did not want their info publicly displayed in this manner.

## Problem ##
This makes gathering emails for an email list very easy.

## Solution ##
This simply takes a users name and email and puts them in a database to be used later.

## Quote from You ##
"Our company is happy to annouce that we will be supporting an email list sign up form in order to express your interest in our events"

## How to Get Started ##
This app is incredibly easy to use.  The user who is interested simply inputs their name and email and we do the rest!

## Customer Quote ##
"I wasn't sure if i was going to sign up, but after seeing how many others were interested in the event, i knew it would be a great time so i signed up as well!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).
